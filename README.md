# 🔐 ZeroHack – Decentralized AI-Powered Cyber Threat Defense

**ZeroHack** is a full-stack cybersecurity solution that combines multi-layered AI with blockchain-based forensics to detect, analyze, and respond to modern cyber threats in real time.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional security systems:
- Fail to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) like stealthy or fileless malware.
- Operate with fixed/static rules, which attackers easily bypass.
- Log events in formats that can be altered or deleted—compromising forensic reliability.
- Respond slowly due to manual intervention and lack of automation.

## 💡 Idea Description

**ZeroHack** is designed to handle today’s evolving cyberattack landscape through:

- **AI-Driven Detection**: Uses natural language processing (NLP), CNN/RNN, LSTM, and Autoencoders to detect malicious content in traffic, payloads, steganography, and even custom protocols.
- **Advanced Packet Analyzer**: Analyzes payloads, image-based threats, and unknown data patterns using deep learning.
- **Immutable Logging**: Stores verified threat incidents on blockchain for tamper-proof, audit-ready forensics.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate response actions like IP quarantine instantly.

> With ZeroHack, security teams get intelligent, autonomous, and tamper-proof protection built for today’s cyber battlefield.

## 🔁 Implementation Flow

1. **Capture Payload or Log File** from the user (upload or live feed).
2. **Preprocess the Input** (extract features, parse headers/payloads).
3. **Run Through AI Models**:
   - NLP: Detect obfuscated command injections
   - CNN/RNN: Identify steganography and covert channels
   - Autoencoders: Detect unknown or undocumented protocols
4. **Generate Threat Score & Type**.
5. **Decide Action** (Allow, Monitor, Quarantine).
6. **Log to Blockchain** using smart contracts if malicious.
7. **Visualize in Dashboard** with real-time updates and threat history.
